# CHATBOT
# ðŸ§  Smart PDF Chatbots

Interact with your PDF documents using two intelligent chatbot applications powered by different LLM and embedding architectures. These bots allow you to upload any PDF, ask natural-language questions, and receive context-aware answersâ€”one with lightweight sentence-transformers, and one with dual LLaMA models that even **score the quality of the generated answers**.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Overview

This repository features **two separate chatbot implementations**, each showcasing a unique architecture for document-based Q&A:

### 1. **LiteBot** â€“ Lightweight Q&A with Sentence-Transformers

An efficient, minimalistic chatbot designed for fast and simple document question-answering. Built using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/), it provides accurate results with minimal dependencies.

- **Technology Stack**:
  - `sentence-transformers` (MiniLM model)
  - FAISS for vector similarity search
  - Streamlit UI
  - PyPDF2 for text extraction

- **Key Features**:
  - Fast PDF parsing and sentence-level chunking
  - Semantic search using normalized embeddings
  - Returns top 3 relevant chunks for any question
  - Highlights the most relevant sentence as the answer

### 2. **JudgeBot** â€“ Advanced Q&A with Dual LLaMA Models (Ollama)

A more powerful Q&A system that uses two LLaMA models via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/): one to answer your questions, and another to **evaluate** the response for relevance and accuracy.

- **Technology Stack**:
  - Ollama for LLaMA model inference
  - FAISS + BM25 hybrid retrieval
  - LangChain integration for modular components
  - Recursive text chunking via LangChain
  - Rank-BM25 for lexical scoring

- **Key Features**:
  - Embedding model for semantic retrieval
  - Answer model generates responses using top-k context
  - Judge model evaluates the answer:
    - **Accuracy Score**
    - **Reasoning Explanation**
    - **Improved Answer Suggestion**
  - Displays top 3 relevant chunks
